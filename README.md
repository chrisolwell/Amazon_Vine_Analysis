# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
We set out to determine if Vine members were more likely to provide positive reviews in exchange for free products. To test this we created a database using AWS, SQL and colabs that allowed us to filter through Amazon user review data. We looked at the data to see if reviewers in the Vine program, exhibit bias in their product reviews. For background, the Vine program was or is one in which, if I understand correctly, companies pay Amazon and provide Vine members with products at no cost in exchange for product reviews. The results...may surprise you.

## Results
Nope. Probably not. (This is a work in progress.)



We wanted to address three questions:
  - How many Vine reviews were there? How many non-Vine reviews?
  - How many Vine reviews were 5-star reviews? How many non-Vine reviews?
  - What percentage of of each category were 5-star reviews?
